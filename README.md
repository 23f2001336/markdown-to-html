# Markdown Renderer

This is a simple, single-file HTML application designed to render Markdown content from an `input.md` file directly in your browser. It leverages modern web technologies to provide a clean, responsive, and easy-to-use solution for viewing Markdown.

## Features

*   **Markdown to HTML Conversion**: Automatically fetches and converts `input.md` into beautifully rendered HTML.
*   **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a great viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes.
*   **Single-File Application**: All necessary code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) is contained within a single `index.html` file, making it easy to deploy and share.
*   **Lightweight**: Uses CDN-hosted libraries (Tailwind CSS, Marked.js) for minimal local footprint.

## Usage

To use this application, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Save the files**: Ensure `index.html` and `input.md` are in the same directory.
2.  **Edit `input.md`**: Place your Markdown content within the `input.md` file.
3.  **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

The application will automatically load `input.md`, convert its content to HTML, and display it on the page.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5**: For the document structure.
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for responsive and modern styling.
*   **Marked.js**: A fast Markdown parser and compiler written in JavaScript.
